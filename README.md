# Calabouços do Convento

### Overview
"Calabouços do Convento" is a multi-path narrative adventure game where you are in charge of your own destiny.

<br>*"No one ever believed in you, often you did not believe in yourself. Despite everything, you've always had enough strength to keep going. A few days ago in a tavern, you heard some eccentric clerics talking about a mystical convent order, usually shrouded in mystery. With nothing to lose, you decided to investigate and, who knows, learn from them the occult arts which, they say, lead their practitioners to fortune.*</br>
<br>*As you reach the top of the mountain with difficulty, your panting breath worsens as you look up. In front of you stands an imposing and fortified building. It's the much-talked-about convent. The oppressive sight of the massive wooden doors are not enough to discourage you.*</br>
<br>*You decide to peek through the door..."*</br>
